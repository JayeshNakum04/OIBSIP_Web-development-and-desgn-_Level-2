## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Implement data persistence with localStorage
- [ ] Add more advanced calculator functions (scientific mode)
- [ ] Include task categories and priorities in Todo app
- [ ] Add password strength validation
- [ ] Implement user profile management
- [ ] Add export functionality for todo lists
- [ ] Include task search and filtering

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Data persistence is session-based (resets on page refresh)
- Calculator has basic error handling (no advanced mathematical functions)
- Authentication is client-side only (demo purposes)
